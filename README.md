# Credit-card-fraud-detetction

# Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for training and testing contains a mix of fraudulent and legitimate transactions. The model is trained using a Random Forest Classifier, a popular ensemble learning method known for its effectiveness in handling imbalanced datasets and capturing complex relationships in the data.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains transaction data, including features such as transaction amount, time, and other relevant transaction details. It is important to note that due to privacy concerns, the dataset does not contain identifiable information about the cardholders.

# Model Training
The Random Forest Classifier is trained on the dataset to learn patterns that distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. The model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its performance.

# Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using a separate test dataset to ensure its generalization to unseen data. The evaluation metrics provide insights into how well the model is able to detect fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

# Deployment
The trained model can be deployed in a production environment to automatically detect fraudulent transactions in real-time. This can help financial institutions and credit card companies in preventing fraud and protecting their customers.

# Dependencies
Python 3.x
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
